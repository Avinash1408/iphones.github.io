The biggest iPhone in Apple's lineup, the iPhone 11 Pro Max looks like an incremental upgrade over the iPhone XS Max but it brings some significant changes under the hood. There's a triple camera setup at the back now, letting you choose between the Wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto lenses.

The Camera app makes it seamless to pick one or the other, presenting the Ultra Wide camera as a 0.5x zoom, which is certainly an interesting perspective. All this is backed by improved HDR and a brand new Night Mode, which means you get excellent image and video quality in most conditions. For the first time in years, Apple's phones not only compete, but often surpass the competition in terms of low light photography.

An area where Apple's dominance has never really been in doubt has been chip design, and the new Apple A13 Bionic chip continues this tradition. From intensive gaming sessions to editing 4K videos on the go, iPhone 11 Pro Max will handle everything you throw at it with ease, and then some.

There are significant gains to be had in the battery life department as well, and even users with the heaviest of workloads shouldn't have a problem lasting a full day. Most typical users will find the iPhone 11 Pro Max is, in fact, capable of lasting up to two days on a single charge. iOS 13 brings a host of new features and the promise of regular software updates.

So what's not to like? Looking beyond that camera module, the price is an obvious deterrent. What's more, despite paying over a lakh, you get a measly 64GB of internal storage. We also wish Apple adds software features like picture-in-picture that make better use of the big screen.
